## Items

* Seeking Stone - Legendary
	* Provides aim assist (and homing projectiles) while reducing recoil and weapon bloom.
	* Accuracy increase essentially acts as an aimbot with limitations that decrease as you stack it. Shotgun purposefully spread not affected by weapon bloom change!
	* Special thanks to Rein for helping me code some of this. Aimbot concept by Lodington
* Adamantium Chestplate - Uncommon
	* Gives a flat increase to your armor.
	* This is different to the Repulsion Armor Plate, which gives flat damage reduction.
* Artemis' Blessing - Lunar
	* Increases damage the further you are from a target. Decreases damage the closer you are to a target.
	* Based off a median range (point where damage output is unaffected) that can be configured in the config.
* Primordial Flesh - Lunar
	* Heal based on your current velocity (Hooray for Loader).
	* Cannot heal from any other means.
	* The only other items that affect the regen by any means are Titanic Knurl and Radiant Pearl.
* Imp Extract - Equipment
	* Transform into an Imp Overlord and wreak havoc for a period of time.
	* *Primary Skill* - Void Spikes
	* *Secondary Skill* - Ground Pound
	* *Utility Skill* - Blink
	* *Special Skill* - Revert Form

* 3.5.9 - Hey everyone still using this mod! For the past two or so months I have been busy graduating high school, but I'm completely done now! My focus can now shift back to my personal projects. I figured I might as well get something out during this update, though. There are two new items in this one, but their art and such has not been completely finished. As usual, please report any bugs with these to me on the ROR2 modding discord.

#### Updates older than this are from the deprecated mod, Kevin's Classic Additions.

* 2.2.4 -
	* Adamantium Chestplate is not broken in the command menu.

* 2.2.3 - Quite the overhaul in this version! I've been working to make the mod independent of ClassicItems, and now it finally is!
	* All items added now have a model of their own
	* No longer dependent on ClassicItems
	* Added Adamantium Chestplate items (Current item icon is a placeholder until I can get the real one)
	* Unfinished equipment "Imp Extract" not implemented, but currently in the works (can be found in files)
	* Minor tweaks to Artemis' Blessing

* 1.0.3 - 
	* Artemis' Blessing now reduces damage falloff on bullet and shotgun damage (See config for options).


## To Do

* Imp Overlord is added to the logbook again. I need to make it so it isn't
* Imp Extract is still a little glitchy
* Make more items
