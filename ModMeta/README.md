## Items

* Imp Extract - Equipment
	* Transform into an Imp Overlord and wreak havoc for a period of time.
	* (May have compatibility issues with Kingrinyov's content. DM me on Discord if anyone confirms this, pls.)
	* NOTE: I am currently aware that this item only works on the host. I will try to get that fixed, though :).
* Artemis' Blessing - Lunar
	* Increases damage the further you are from a target. Decreases damage the closer you are to a target.
	* Based off a median range (point where damage output is unaffected) that can be configured in the config.
* Primordial Flesh - Lunar
	* Heal based on your current velocity (Hooray for Loader).
	* Cannot heal from any other means.
	* Also, other vanilla regen items do not affect the regeneration, e.g. Meat, Slug, or Acrid's Melee.
* Adamantium Chestplate - Uncommon
	* Gives a flat increase to your armor.
	* This is different to the Repulsion Armor Plate, which gives flat damage reduction.
* Seeking Stone - Uncommon
	* Increases accuracy and projectile speed, reduces recoil and weapon bloom.
	* Accuracy increase essentially acts as an aimbot with limitations that decrease as you stack it. Shotgun spread not affected by weapon bloom change!
	* Special thanks to Rein for helping me code some of this. Aimbot concept by Lodington

## Changelog

* 3.5.9 - Hey everyone still using this mod! For the past two or so months I have been busy graduating high school, but I'm completely done now! My focus can now shift back to my personal projects. I figured I might as well get something out during this update, though. There are two new items in this one, but their art and such has not been completely finished. As usual, please report any bugs with these to me on the ROR2 modding discord.
	* Updated for 1.0.3.1
	* Switched to use Item_V2 in the 3.0 version of TILER2
	* Uncommon Item "Seeking Stone" released (some art missing)
	* Lunar Item "Primordial Flesh" released (all art missing)
	* Adamantium Chestplate default armor value increased to 15.
	* Switched out low-poly model of Imp Extract for the HD one; changed shaders for it.
	* Minor Changes

* 2.4.8 -
	* Added lore for new items (Thanks to Keroro1454!).
	* Default armor from Adamantium Chestplate buffed to 15.
	* Minor Changes

* 2.3.6 - Fresh start with a new name!
	* Equipment "Imp Extract" released
	* Adamantium Chestplate icon added; fixed Artemis' Blessing icon to have blue outline
	* Minor changes not worth mentioning
	
#### Updates older than this are from the deprecated mod, Kevin's Classic Additions.

* 2.2.4 -
	* Adamantium Chestplate is not broken in the command menu.

* 2.2.3 - Quite the overhaul in this version! I've been working to make the mod independent of ClassicItems, and now it finally is!
	* All items added now have a model of their own
	* No longer dependent on ClassicItems
	* Added Adamantium Chestplate items (Current item icon is a placeholder until I can get the real one)
	* Unfinished equipment "Imp Extract" not implemented, but currently in the works (can be found in files)
	* Minor tweaks to Artemis' Blessing

* 1.0.3 - 
	* Artemis' Blessing now reduces damage falloff on bullet and shotgun damage (See config for options).


## To Do

* Imp Extract only works for host (singleplayer-only).
* Lunar Item Primordial Flesh coded, requires model and icon
* Lunar Item Seeking Stone coded, requires icon
* May remaster the model for Artemis' Blesing, will DEFINITELY remaster icon for Artemis' Blessing
* May or May not do this: Makes items show up on the player model.
