# Kevin's Classics

Adds additional items to the game.

Built off of ThinkInvisible's ClassicItems and TILER2. Special thanks to him for making those and for helping me.
Thanks to Nebulon for making the icons and models used!

These items ARE NOT items ported from Risk of Rain 1.

## Items

• Artemis' Blessing - A Lunar Item; Increases damage the further you are from a target, but there is a median range from the target where if you are closer than range, you will do reduced damage. (This does not affect damage falloff on characters like Commando. I will probably change this in the future.)

• Adamantium Chestplate - Uncommon Item; Gives a flat increase to your armor. This is different to the Repulsion Armor Plate


## Changelog

1.0.3 - 
	• Artemis' Blessing now reduces damage falloff on bullet and shotgun damage (See config for options)

2.2.3 - Quite the overhaul in this version! I've been working to make the mod independent of ClassicItems, and now it finally is!
	• All items added now have a model of their own
	• No longer dependent on ClassicItems
	• Added Adamantium Chestplate items
	• Unfinished equipment "Imp Extract" not implemented, but currently in the works (can be found in files)
	• Minor tweaks to Artemis' Blessing

NOTE: In the next update, this mod will be deprecated and a new one will be made in its place due to the name discrepancy. I thought I ouught to get it out there, though.
