Adds additional items to the game.

Special thanks to Nebulon for making the icons and models used!

## Items

* Artemis' Blessing - Lunar
	* Increases damage the further you are from a target, but there is a median range from the target where if you are closer than range, you will do reduced damage.
* Adamantium Chestplate - Uncommon
	* Gives a flat increase to your armor. This is different to the Repulsion Armor Plate, which gives flat damage reduction.
* Imp Extract - Equipment
	* Transform into an Imp Overlord and wreak havoc for a period of time.


## Changelog

* 2.3.6 - Fresh start with a new name!
	* Equipment "Imp Extract" released
	* Adamantium Chestplate icon added; fixed Artemis' Blessing icon to have blue outline
	* Minor changes not worth mentioning
	
#### Updates older than this are from the deprecated mod, Kevin's Classic Additions.

* 2.2.5 - I fucked up on the release of 2.2.4. This fixes that.

* 2.2.4 -
	* Adamantium Chestplate is not broken in the command menu.

* 2.2.3 - Quite the overhaul in this version! I've been working to make the mod independent of ClassicItems, and now it finally is!
	* All items added now have a model of their own
	* No longer dependent on ClassicItems
	* Added Adamantium Chestplate items (Current item icon is a placeholder until I can get the real one)
	* Unfinished equipment "Imp Extract" not implemented, but currently in the works (can be found in files)
	* Minor tweaks to Artemis' Blessing

* 1.0.3 - 
	* Artemis' Blessing now reduces damage falloff on bullet and shotgun damage (See config for options).
